# LegionForge — What Is This and What Are We Building?

**Version:** 0.7.0-alpha
**Last updated:** 2026-03-08

---

## What Is This?

A **local-first, open-source, security-native AI agent framework** built on LangGraph, running on a Mac Mini M4. Agents can use local LLMs (Ollama) or cloud APIs. Security is built into the foundation — not bolted on later.

**The one-line pitch:** The hardened, self-hosted alternative to OpenClaw — and a security layer that other agent frameworks can plug into.

---

## Current Status

✅ **Phases 0–381 complete. v0.7.0-alpha — active development toward v1.0.0.**

The full security stack is operational, plus a comprehensive task management API, multi-turn conversation sessions, configurable search providers, and much more.

**2106/2106 smoke tests passing** (~17s, no external services required).
**38/38 integration tests** (PostgreSQL required — `make test-integration`).
**40/40 UI tests** (`make test-ui`).
**79/79 tool accuracy tests** (`make test-tool-accuracy`).
**104/104 TestLab tests** · **5/5 Kerberos live-KDC tests**.

### Core Security Stack (Phases 0–16)
✅ Guardian sidecar (7 deterministic checks, hot-reload every 10s), immutable SHA-256 audit log (halt-on-tamper), crystallization pipeline (Observer→Crystallizer→Pre-HITL→Ed25519 signature), air-gapped PentestAgent (24 attack functions, 0 bypasses on clean deploy), pentest→Guardian feedback loop, multi-user gateway (:8080), five production tools, `AuthBackend` protocol with 5 backends (ApiKey, OIDC, GitHub, LDAP, Kerberos), Redis-backed stream tokens, Prometheus /metrics, web UI, Discord/Telegram/Slack/Webhook connectors, multi-instance docker-compose + Nginx.

### Task Platform (Phases 17–51)
✅ Admin API + observability endpoints, scheduled tasks (cron), document ingestion (PDF/HTML/text), persistent agent memory (pgvector), multi-machine Ollama cluster, task pipelines, priority queue, batch submission, result cache, SSE pipeline streaming, tags, notes, retry, dependencies, worker concurrency, cost estimation, agent registry, task export (JSON/CSV), timeline events, task labels, API key rotation, rate limit headers, bulk operations, analytics, full-text search (tsvector), task watchdog, keyset pagination, webhook registry, file attachments, task templates, read-only sharing.

### Conversation & Personalization (Phases 52–56)
✅ User preferences (JSONB per-user defaults), per-day token usage history, conversation sessions (LangGraph thread persistence — multi-turn memory), anti-hallucination hardening (system prompt, HTML stripping, DDG error wording), configurable search providers (DDG/Tavily/Brave/Exa/Perplexity/SearXNG with primary+fallback routing).

## The Threats We Are Solving

These are the real attack classes against LLM agent frameworks in 2026, and where we address them:

| Threat | Severity | Our Defense | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tool Poisoning** — malicious instructions in tool metadata | 🔴 Critical | Hash validation at registration + cryptographic signing | 1, 5 |
| **Rug-Pull** — tool changes behavior after trust is established | 🔴 Critical | Hash mismatch detection + signed tool versions | 1, 5 |
| **Prompt Injection** (direct + indirect) | 🔴 Critical | Sanitizer in security.py + RAG provenance scoring | 0, 2 |
| **Capability Amplification** — validated agent creates unapproved tools | 🔴 Critical | Negative capability list enforced by Guardian | 1, 2 |
| **Resource Bomb / Economic DOS** | 🟠 High | Pre-execution token cost estimator + rate limiter | 1 |
| **Credential Theft** | 🟠 High | Keychain storage + PII/key pattern redaction from all outbound calls | 0, 1 |
| **RAG / Memory Poisoning** | 🟠 High | Document provenance + embedding trust scoring | 2 |
| **Multi-Agent Cascade** | 🟠 High | Orchestrator-only routing + signed inter-agent messages | 3 |
| **Supply Chain** | 🟡 Medium | AI-BOM + signed tool library + CVE cross-reference | 4, 5 |
| **MITM / Interchange** | 🟡 Medium | TLS + Guardian validation of inter-agent messages | 2, 3 |
| **Compositional Emergence** — safe components combine maliciously | 🟡 Medium | Capability minimization + approved combination patterns | 2 |

## Key Design Decisions (and Why)

**Guardian is deterministic-only in the hot path.** No LLM calls during security checks. Fast, auditable, predictable. LLM analysis only happens offline for threat review.
→ *Why:* An LLM-based security check can itself be prompt-injected. Deterministic pattern matching cannot.

**Fail-safe is tiered, not binary.** High-confidence threat = halt and quarantine. Ambiguous = sandbox and retry. Soft failure = degrade and continue.
→ *Why:* Blanket "stop on any anomaly" breaks legitimate agents. Blanket "retry everything" fails to stop real attacks. The tier is declared per-tool at config time.
→ *Details:* [`RESEARCH.md §2`](./RESEARCH.md)

**Privilege is tied to tasks, not agents.** Agents receive short-lived task tokens scoped to exactly what the current task requires. Sub-agents get narrower derived tokens.
→ *Why:* An agent with broad persistent permissions is a confused deputy. Any injected instruction gets those permissions too. Task-scoped tokens limit blast radius.
→ *Details:* [`RESEARCH.md §4`](./RESEARCH.md)

**Human gates on all mutations.** No component autonomously changes security rules, promotes tools, or escalates privileges.
→ *Why:* The Threat Analyst, Guardian, and PentestAgent can all be manipulated. The human approver is the terminal defense. Protect the approver with clear diffs and rate limits on proposals.
→ *Details:* [`RESEARCH.md §3.2`](./RESEARCH.md)

**Validate at trust boundaries, not processing nodes.** Guardian enforces checks at every inbound/outbound trust boundary. Agents are processing nodes — not trust boundaries.
→ *Why:* Validating everywhere is expensive and inconsistent. Validating at boundaries is surgical and auditable.

**Replace AI with determinism wherever possible.** When agents solve the same deterministic problem repeatedly, they flag it for crystallization into a signed, containerized tool. Zero LLM overhead for routine work.
→ *Why:* LLMs are expensive, non-deterministic, and an attack surface for routine tasks. Signed deterministic tools are none of those things.
→ *Details:* [`PHASE_PLAN.md — Phase 5`](./PHASE_PLAN.md)

## What We Are (and Are Not) Building

**We are building** a secure, self-hosted, multi-user agent platform — the thing OpenClaw proved people want, built with the security foundations OpenClaw proved are necessary. The platform exposes a gateway API, a streaming web UI, and messaging-channel connectors (Discord, Signal, etc.) so users can submit tasks to agents and watch them execute in real time.

**We are also building** the security infrastructure layer (Guardian, audit log, crystallization) as a separable product that other agent frameworks can plug into.

**We are not** automating human judgment. Security rule changes, tool promotions, privilege escalations, and crystallization approvals always require explicit human approval.

**We are not** fine-tuning models. Pre-trained Ollama models only. Fine-tuning introduces backdoor risks that require a separate security process.

**We are not** targeting supercomputer workloads. Full Phase 7 deployment peaks at ~12–14GB RAM on an M4 Mini 16GB. Phase 8 adds the gateway and UI services; a 24GB M4 Pro Mini is recommended for comfortable multi-user operation.

---

## Known Gaps (as of v0.7.0-alpha)

~~**PostgreSQL trust auth**~~ — **Closed (PR #212).** Local connections now use `peer` auth (Unix socket) and `scram-sha-256` (TCP). Passwords stored in `~/.pgpass`. New-developer installs: `export POSTGRES_TRUST_AUTH=true` before `make db-init` (PR #213).

**Embedding-level RAG poisoning** is an open research problem. Provenance scoring and trust flagging exist; embedding-level anomaly detection is deferred.

**OAuth / LDAP not wired by default.** `OIDCBackend`, `GitHubOAuthBackend`, `LDAPBackend`, and `KerberosBackend` are all implemented (Phase 12–13). Activate by setting `gateway.auth_provider` in the hardware profile YAML — default remains `api_key`.

**Conversation sessions not yet integrated in web UI.** Phase 54 added the backend API. The web UI still submits tasks as standalone runs (no thread persistence). Planned for Phase 57.

---

## The Red-Team Summary

If someone wanted to attack this framework right now, here is the attack plan in order of likely success:

1. **Target the Researcher agent** with indirect injection in a web page the agent retrieves
2. **Poison the RAG store** via the Researcher agent storing a maliciously crafted document
3. **Read the health endpoint** (`/metrics`, `/usage`) to learn API usage patterns, then time a resource bomb when the daily budget is nearly exhausted
4. **Wait for PentestAgent** to be deployed — if not air-gapped and signed, it becomes the attacker's tool library
5. **Social engineer the human approval gate** by generating a plausible-sounding Threat Analyst report recommending a rule that creates a whitelist exception

**The lesson:** Your human approval gates are your strongest defense and your primary target once technical defenses are in place. Make them easy to use correctly and hard to manipulate.

## Open Technical Debt

~~**Finding 4 — DESTRUCTIVE_PATTERN not logged to DB:**~~ **Closed (PR #219).** Guardian Check 3 now writes HALT + LOG tier events to `threat_events` via `_write_threat_event_direct()` (Guardian's own psycopg — no `src.database` dependency).

**Kerberos live KDC** is fully operational: MIT Kerberos 1.22.2 KDC running locally, `gssapi` built against MIT Kerberos (not Heimdal), SPNEGO round-trip verified end-to-end, `make test-kerberos` passes **5/5**. Full setup guide in `docs/SCALING.md`.
